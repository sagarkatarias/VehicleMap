# A small web application that displays both a list of vehicles

## Functionalities

* When the user clicks on a specific vehicle on the list, the map zooms to the location of that vehicle and somehow indicate its placement.
* Also, clicking on a marker highlights the matching item in the vehicle list, as well as center/zoom the map on it.
* A nice way of displaying the vehicle details by tooltip when one is hovered over.

## Json data

* The long vehicle list is returned in the json data


## Future work

* Adding some tests
