# Sagar Kataria

Dear Share now team. This is a quick prototype SPA for the task you assigned to me. All the 4 tasks were completed.

## Libraries used

I chose to go with vanilla javascript without any frameworks just for the pure sake of building the app as quickly as possible also when using on is not a selection criteria, I thought leaflet is much simpler without any framework. 
Used Leaflet for maps and bootstrap for the table.

## Serving json

I used jsonbin.io to serve the json file. You can be sure about security there because it is a private repository and needs a secret key to access it. Which I pass in the header of the fetch call.

## Future work

If you like my work and would like to proceed further with my application, I would add some tests but I did not do that yet because I am not sure right now if I am still in consideration for the position since the process has been going on for a while and in my past experiences I made big projects and never got proper feedbacks. So looking forward to hearing from you soon.
